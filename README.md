# MinecraftTextureScrambler
## Requirements
Version: Windows 10

Minecraft Release: 1.16.2 preferred

## Installation
Go to the [releases tab](https://github.com/InfinitiStudios/MinecraftTextureScrambler/releases/tag/1.0.0) and install the latest version. This will download a zip file that needs to be extracted.

## Usage
Once extracted, open the folder and double click on the `main.exe` file and a console window should pop up. This means that the textures are being generated. Once the generation process is complete, the console window will close and there will be a `textures` file in the root directory. Now you can just copy the folder to your resourcepacks folder. If you don't know where that is, then press the windows button and search `%appdata%` and click on the first result (which should open a folder). From there, go to
```
.minecraft\resourcepacks\
```
then drag the generated `textures` folder into the `resourcepacks` folder. Next, open Minecraft, then go to `Options > Resource Packs` then you should see the new textures option! Just click the arrow over the textures icon then press done. Congradulations! You just fucked up! If you want a different generated textures folder, simply go back to the folder you unzipped and double click on the `main.exe` once more. Then just put the newly generated textures folder (It will overwrite the old textures folder) into your resource packs folder.


#### WARNING: DO NOT EDIT OR DELETE THE `RES` FOLDER OR ANYTHING IN IT OR ELSE THE TEXTURES MIGHT NOT GENERATE CORRECTLY
